	<h2>Stripped Grey Mullet, Mugil Cephalus-State fish for Goa</h2><br><br>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The contribution of marine and coastal fisheries to the Indian economy is very 
 significant which is shown by the huge employment opportunities that it creates in primary, 
secondary and tertiary sectors, foreign exchange and meeting the food security. The Indian 
fisheries industry contributes to about 1-1.4% of the total GDP. The value of the marine fish 
landings at the point of first sale- 30,000 crores and 40, 000 crores at the point of last sales 
(CMFRI, 2015). Fish assumes greater significance to the people of Goa and it forms an 
integral part of Goan life and culture as it forms one of the most important items of the food 
of more than 90% percent of population. Goa is the state with a coast line of 104 km (1.28% 
of Indian coast line of 8117 km) with numerous bays and headlands. The continental shelf 
area of Goa extends to about 10,000 km2
of about 100 fathoms depths. The fisheries sector 
contributes to about 2.5% of the total GDP of the state (third position after West Bengal and 
A.P.) and 17.1% of the agricultural GDP of the State. Thus fishing industry of Goa plays a 
vital role in socio-economic development of Goa by contributing substantially towards Net 
State Domestic Product through export and domestic trade annually. In India fish eating 
population is about 56% of the total population (Planning Commission, Govt. of India), 
Percapita fish consumption is about 8.49 kg. Goa contributes to about 1.85% of the total 
marine fish landings of our country (CMFRI, 2013).
</p>
<p>Marine and coastal fisheries contribute 97% of the total fish production from Goa. 
Goa is bestowed with 330 ha of brackishwater resources which hold good potential in the 
fisheries development, particularly through capture and coastal aquaculture. The total 
estuarine area in Goa is 13,157 ha with Mandovi and Zuari are the two major estuaries known 
as life lines of Goa. These are inter-connected by Cumbharjua canal, 14 km and 11 km away 
from the mouth of the respective estuaries. Both the estuaries open into the sea at Dona Paula 
beach. The salinity and tidal effects are very much pronounced, except in June-September of 
the year, when there is heavy inflow of fresh water into the Sea. Mandovi estuary is five 
kilometers wide at the mouth region, where as Zuari is about seven kilometers wide. The 
estuarine bed of the 253 Mandovi River is mostly sandy or muddy, whereas, Zuari is mostly 
rocky.</p>
<p>
	The inland fish production of Goa, which is 4678 tonnes in 2013, is majorly supported 
by the brackishwater and estuarine fish production. The major fisheries resources are prawns 
and shrimps, clams, mullets, catfish, pearlspot, crabs, glassy perchlets, ladyfish, silverbiddies, 
scat, milkfish and anchovies. There is a significant hike inland fish production in Goa during 
the last five years. It is also observed that there is abundant natural stocks of seeds of 
brackishwater fishes like Pearlspot, Etroplus suratensis, Asian Seabass, Lates calcarifer and
Mullets (Mugil cephalus, Valamugil cunnesius, Liza parsia, L. tade) etc. in the estuaries and 
backwaters of Goa which can be utilised for culture purpose (Sreekanth, 2015). The state also 
holds enormous scope in developing coastal aquaculture activities including finfish cage 
culture, mussel and oyster culture etc. Coastal and brackishwater finfishes, clams, mussels 
and oysters have a great demand for consumption in the fish markets of Goa. The production 
from the coastal water bodies can be also increased using the strategic interventions in coastal 
aquaculture systems. The group mullets with 4-5 species contribute significantly to the 
coastal and brackishwater fisheries of Goa and the species stripped Grey mullet, Mugil 
cephalus is the dominant species in this group. This species provides significant contribution 
in quantity and value of the coastal fisheries of Goa. There is a good demand for this fish 
from the retail markets and hotel industry in Goa. Apart from fishing it also holds scope as a 
candidate species for coastal aquaculture. Further, this fish can be also used for preparing 
various value added products and thus provides an opportunity for processing and value 
addition. In the following sections, the scope for recommending grey mullet as state fish for 
Goa is discussed
</p>
<h2>Stripped Grey Mullet, Mugil cephalus</h2>
<p>Stripped grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) is a species of mullet in the Mugilidae family under
the order Mugiliformes. It is commonly found in the coastal waters of the tropical, 
subtropical and temperate zones of world. It is an important food fish around the globe. It is 
also significant as a potential aquaculture species and a game fish. It is even used as bait
(smaller size) for catching the larger pelagic and demersal fishes. The grey mullet is exploited 
by different types of gears (gillnets, castnets, stake nets, barrier nets, lift nets, beach seines
and hook and lines) and crafts (Artisanal, Motorised and Mechanised). Besides, all the major, 
medium and minor landing centres along South and North Goa land mullets as a one of the 
fish groups. The species also hold scope for coastal aquaculture and value addition.

<h4 align="center">Source: Fish base, 2014</h3>
	<h3 align="center">Fig. 4. Species life history sheet for grey mullet</h3>
	<h2>Growth</h2>
	<p>It is reported that Grey mullet reaches a maximum total length of 100 centimetres in standard 
length, but are generally on an average 40-50 centimetres in length. Maximum reported age 
attained is 16 years. The maximum reported weight is 12 kg seems too high for the area and it 
remains to be confirmed (Fishbase, 2014).</p>
<h2>Biology (Habitat, feeding and spawning)</h2>
<p>Adults are found in coastal waters, often entering estuaries and rivers, sometimes far-up-river, lagoons and hyper-saline environments. They are usually in schools over sand or mud 
bottom, between 0 and 10 m, occurring equally in tropical, subtropical and temperate waters. 
They are mainly diurnal, feeding on detritus, micro-algae and benthic organisms. Juveniles 
feed on zooplankton until about 3.0 cm of standard length. Reproduction takes place at sea, at 
various times of the year depending on the location. There is absence of an obligatory 
freshwater phase in the life cycle. Females spawn 0.8 to 2.6 million eggs which develop at 
sea. Sexually mature at 3 to 4 years at an average size of 35-45 cm. The spawning usually 
occurs during October to December along the southwest coast of India and in Goa also. 
Generally, the fecundity ranges from 1 to 5 lakhs. One spawning aggregation was observed in 
detail. This consisted of five fish, a female and four males. Males would press against the 
female, which took place as the entire group moved along slowly, facing into a fairly strong 
tidal flow.</p>
<h2>Gears of catch</h2>
<p>The grey mullet is exploited by different types of gears (gillnets, castnets, stake nets, barrier 
nets, lift nets, beach seines and hook and lines) and crafts (artisanal, motorised and 
mechanised)</p>
<h2>Utilisation</h2>
<p>It is marketed fresh, dried, salted, and frozen; roe sold fresh or smoked; also used in Chinese 
medicine. It is a delicacy in Goa and various preparations like fried, smoked, dried and gravy 
preparations are made from this species. It is nutritionally superior with high quality protein, 
essential amino acids and fatty acids. The proximate composition of grey mullet is reported 
by Gopakumar (2002) as: Moisture: 74.9%, Protein: 20.8%, Fat: 5.1% and Ash: 0.6%.

	<h3 align="center">Fig. 5. Contribution of various fisheries groups to total inland production</h3>
	<p>With an average catch of 280 tonnes per annum, mullets contributes to about 7% of the total 
inland fish production along Goa and the major contribution (about 80%) is from grey mullet, 
Mugil cephalus (Fig. 5). Thus grey mullet holds an important role in the fisheries livelihood 
and socioeconomic scenario of the coastal fishermen in Goa. In terms of value of the inland 
and coastal fish production in Goa, this species holds a significant contribution.</p>

	<h3 align="center">Fig. 6. Year wise catch (tonnes) of grey mullet along Goa during 2001-2013
</h3>
<p>The fishery of mullets especially the grey mullet has shown linear increasing trend over the 
last decade in Goa (Fig. 6). In the last decade, the fishery started declining from 337 tonnes in 
2001 to 144 tonnes in 2002. This decline was followed by a continuous increase in the mullet 
landings from 2002 to 2012 with a peak values during 2012 and 2009. The average catch 
during this period was found to be 280 tonnes. Recently there was a decline in the landings 
from 391 tonnes in 2012 to 336 tonnes in 2013. In general, the catch was increasing and this 
may be attributed to the increased demand for this fish triggered by the increase in price for 
the other preferred marine species. In Goa, Grey mullet can be considered as an optimally 
exploited fishery with an optimal catch. However, the statement should be refined or 
substantiated with planned population studies along the coast.</p>

	<h3 align="center">Fig. 7. Gross value (crores) for mullets at landing and retail points in Goa
</h3>
<p>The gross value of landings at landing and retail level were gradually increasing over the 
years. The gross values at both landing and retail have shot up to ₹ 25.2 and ₹ 39.1 lakhs
during 2014 from ₹ 3.68 and ₹ 5.92 lakhs in 2010 (Fig. 7). Thus it is obvious that mullet
contributes major share to the fisheries livelihood of the state and the state’s fisheries GDP. 
The average landing and retail prices for mullet stood at ₹ 100 and ₹ 150 along Goa during 
2014 from ₹ 23 and ₹ 37 respectively in 2000. However, this prices are average prices 
estimated using the weekly prices of the fish for the entire year. Moreover, this is expected to 
increase further in the coming future. The average annual price at landing and retail points for 
grey mullet has followed a continuous linear trend. The price at landing was increased from 
₹ 23 to ₹ 100 with an annual average growth rate of 23.9% (Fig. 8). Similarly, the price at 
retail was increased from ₹ 37 to ₹ 150 with an annual average growth rate of 21.8%. The 
Percentage Share of Fishermen in Consumer Rupee (PSFCR) for mullet was reducing from 
42.3% in 2000 to 60.3% in 2014 (Fig. 9). The higher rate of increase in the retail price at 
retail point in comparison with the landing point might have widened the gap between 
landing and retail price which in turn reduced the PSFCR.</p>

	<h2>Aquaculture potential</h2>
	<p>The grey mullet, Mugil cephalus is the most dominant species of the mullet groups and it is 
the fastest growing mullet species. Though it primarily feeds on the diatoms and epiphytic 
algae, it can adapt itself to artificial diet. The size at maturity of the species is at 3 to 4 years 
at an average size of 35-45 cm. The spawning season in India is from October to May and the 
fry availability along the coastal regions is strictly seasonal. Along the west coast the fry 
availability is maximum during the monsoon (July-September) and in the east coast, the peak 
abundance will be in pre-monsoon season (February to April). Spawning occurs in offshore 
waters where warm water current exists with a surface temperature of 20-23°C. The common 
marketable size is 500-800 g (30-50 cm). It is a hardy eurythermal (0 to 40°C) and euryhaline 
(0 to 145 ppt) species which make it suitable for the coastal aquaculture activities. Grey 
mullet possesses hardiness and ability to tolerate considerable fluctuations in salinity and 
temperature, ability to grow fast in brackishwater ponds, adaptability to supplementary diet, 
high survival rate and good market demand. The monoculture of this species is not found 
lucrative because of the low production rates. There is a practice of growing this species in 
mixed or polyculture systems based on the natural seed availability. The combined culture of 
fish (1-2 species) and shrimps are reported to augment the production in coastal aquaculture 
systems. Since the grey mullet satisfies all favourable characteristics to be part of such a 
coastal aquaculture system, it can be undoubtedly recommended as a fish species for 
inclusion in the coastal aquaculture system. </p>

<h2>Value addition</h2>
<p>The flesh of this lean fish species is with firm texture, light meat with moderate flavour and 
the meat yield from this species is reported as 42%. The protein and lipid content of this fish 
is about 21 mg/g and 1.91 mg/g respectively. Extremely versatile and with low cholesterol 
content, mullet can be prepared in a variety of ways without fear of its becoming too dry: 
barbecued, baked, broiled, deep-fat, fried, over-baked, pan fried or smoked. There are 
possibilities for the development of mince based products from this fish like surimi and 
surimi-based products, sausages, protein concentrates and hydrolysates, and extruded 
products. In addition to the mullet flesh, the roe (both white and yellow) and gizzards are also 
edible.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thus, the grey mullet, Mugil cephalus undoubtedly contributes significantly to the coastal
fisheries of Goa in terms of quantity and value. The utilisation of this species in Goa is 
incomplete as it is commonly used for traditional preparations and fresh consumption. The 
value of the fish at landing and retail points were increasing since the last few years. As this 
species contribute significantly to the coastal fisheries of Goa, the precious resource should 
be conserved by different management approaches with the limitation of effort, regulation of 
mesh size and adoption of sustainable coastal aquaculture practices. Hence, there is possible 
scope for proposing grey mullet, Mugil cephalus as the state fish for Goa with the underlined 
background.
