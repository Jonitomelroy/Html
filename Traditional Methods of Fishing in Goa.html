	<p>Goans have long relied on fishing as a central occupation due to their location on the coast. Fishing communities in Goa are distinguished by their surnames, including Kharvi, Nustekar, Arrikar, Kantaikar, Magkar, Pagelkar, and Ramponkar. Although modern trawlers and machinery have largely replaced traditional fishing methods, many Goans still depend on local fishing communities for their daily catch. These communities practice sustainable and nature-friendly methods, driven not by profit but by respect for nature's cycles. To allow fish stocks to replenish, fishing is prohibited during the monsoon season in Goa. Goan cuisine is also known for its strict guidelines regarding the appropriate fish to consume during specific seasons.<br><br>

    Goa has a long history of traditional fishing practices that have been passed down through generations of fishermen. Fishing has been a way of life for many communities in the state of Goa. The traditional methods of fishing in Goa are diverse and unique, and some of them are still practiced by local fishermen today.

    <h1>Here are some of the traditional methods of fishing in Goa.</h1></p>
<br>
<br>
<img src="fish/stake-fishing-method-goa.jpg" height="350vh" border="20px">
<h2>Khutani or Khutavanni Fishing in Goa</h2>
<p>The indigenous technique of stake fishing, called khutani or khutavanni, involves the use of wooden poles staked into the river with a net attached across them to ensnare fish. The catch is collected during low tide. This method is particularly popular during the monsoon season for catching tambuso (red snapper), chonak (sea bass), and dodiyare (croaker).</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2>kobulem</h2>
<p>Catching crabs to make that delicious crab curry requires equipment called jhaari. In jhaari, a net laid against a circular metal frame called kobulem is placed on the river in clusters. Kept at a distance of 50 metres between jhaari, the metal frames allow for the traps to be placed at a uniform level in the water. A string is tied to the sets of jhaari. When fishermen detect movement in the string, they take action to remove the nets. Clams are caught by free divers using their hands, and oysters are dug for on seashores and riverbanks.</p>
<br>
<br>
<img src="fish/ramponn-traditional-fishing-method-in-goa.jpg" height="600vh" border="20px">
<h2>Ramponn </h2>
<p>One of the most common traditional fishing methods in Goa is the use of nets. Fishermen use different types of nets depending on the type of fish they are targeting and the depth of the water. For example, some fishermen use drift nets, which are left to float in the water and capture fish that swim into them, while others use gill nets, which are set up vertically in the water and capture fish that swim through them.<br><br>

Ramponn is a traditional fishing method that uses a large seine net that is pulled by a group of fishermen from the shore into the sea. The net is then closed and pulled back to the shore, capturing fish and other marine life in the process.<br>
<br>
To employ the Ramponn fishing method, fishermen navigate a canoe through the waters in a circular motion while dragging a net behind them. This technique is particularly effective in catching larger fish varieties such as snapper, grouper, barramundi, shark, barracuda, and lobster during the monsoon season.</p>
<br><br>
<img src="fish/rod-fishing.jpg" height="590vh" border="20px">
<h2>Gorovop (rod-fishing) and poler (line-fishing) </h2>
<p>Gorovop (rod-fishing) and poler (line-fishing) are both methods of angling. In the former, a nylon string with a hook is tied to a wooden or bamboo stick. Baits and hooks used depend on the kind of fish one wants to catch. Smaller fish and rice dough are common as bait. In the latter method, one wants to catch a larger variety of fish, so a nylon string sans rod with more enticing bait like a big prawn or a crab is flung into the water. Of course, bamboo rods have now been replaced with advanced fishing rods available today; nylon string has been replaced with all kinds of specialty fishing lines. Even with upgraded technology, these simpler methods of fishing can be seen as fun pastime all over Goa.</p>
<br><br>
<img src="fish/Sluice-gate-1.jpg" height="590vh" border="20px">
<h2>Manas or Poin - Sluice Gates</h2>
<p>To catch fish in Goa's rivers, fishermen use a traditional method called Manas or Poin. This technique involves the use of sluice gates, which are used to regulate the flow of water during the ebb and flow of tides. The gates are also used to trap fish at low tide when they are closed. This is a sustainable and efficient way of catching fish without causing harm to the environment.</p>
<br><br>
<img src="fish/cast-net-fishing-from-boat-kathalli-in-goa.jpg" height="600vh" border="20px">
<h2>Kaathalli - Cast Net Fishing in Goa</h2>
<p>To catch fish like khorsani, shevtali, conge, and tigur during the monsoon, Goan fishermen use a method called cast net fishing or kaathalli. This involves laying out a net that is typically 200-300 meters long with small floats running across one side to help it spread over the water like a screen. This method is also used with a smaller net, called paguer, which is cast by a single person. These fishing techniques are a staple of Goan culture and cuisine, and the types of fish caught using these methods are highly regarded for their quality and taste. <br><br>

This method involves using a large fishing net that is thrown into the water by a group of fishermen from a boat. The net is then pulled back to the boat, capturing fish and other marine life in the process.<br><br>

Some traditional fishing practices in Goa are seasonal, and fishermen may only use certain methods during specific times of the year. For example, during the monsoon season, when the sea is rough and the waves are high, some fishermen use traditional catamarans or wooden boats to fish in the shallow waters close to shore.</p><br><br>
<img src="fish/fishing-using-lights-goa.jpg" height="600vh" border="20px">
<h2>Dipkavnni - Fishing </h2>
<p>Dipkavnni is a method of using light sources to confuse fish. Back in the day, paraffin or kerosene lamps were used to shock fish and then catch them with a handheld net. Today, people use high-beam torches in shallow water to do the same.</p>
<br><br>
<img src="fish/fishing-in-goa-using-trawlers.jpg" height="670vh" border="20px">
<h2>Trawling - Modern way of Fishing in Goa</h2>
<p>Trawling is a modern method of fishing that involves using a large net that is dragged along the sea bed by a boat. This method is commonly used in Goa by commercial fishermen.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Kanni or Zaali - Barrier Net Fishing in Goa</h2>
<p>Kanni, also known as zaali, is a form of barrier net fishing that requires two or more people, depending on the catch. Two fishermen hold a rectangular net with bamboo sticks on either side as they move through shallow waters. For deeper bodies of water like ponds, more men may be needed to pull a larger net. Similar to khutani, this method is used during the monsoon season to catch fish such as tambuso, dodiyare, muddoshi, and tambdem bhalem (red eel). When a semi-circular net is used with a bamboo frame, the same method is referred to as zaali, which is used for catching shrimp in muddy sections of shallow waters.</p>
